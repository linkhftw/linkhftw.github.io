### Fruits vs Veggies Rap
```
Fruits:
You grow from a plant
I grow from the best
Veggies are disgusting
And we ain’t a mess!

Veggies:
Your apples are too crunchy
Carrots, yum
You’re such a lil’ baby
We healthier than a plum

Fruits:
You barely even taste good.
You barely even rap.
You barely have potassium,
You little piece of scrap!

Veggies:
Fruits like you are kinda lame.
The trash is the last thing you’ll see (see).
We’re strong, buff, really jacked,
And it’s over to Mr. Leek! (leek!)

Mr. Leek:
I’m Mr. Leek and things can happen
Like when kids are called to the house.
But then they look so sad and mournful
Cuz’ they taste you in their mouth.

Fruits:
Ooo, tough words coming from a bad seed.
You’re a dumb plant no one will ever need.
You’re acting like a lil’ baby carrot.
Hope you get fed to a parrot.

END

### Veggie Rap ft. The Healthy Crew 
```
So we back up in the alleyway,
Eating some fruit.
This man comes up to us
Sayin’ “Listen up dude”.

“If ya wanna eat so healthy,
So healthy, so good,
Then ya gonna have to listen here
All up in the hood”.

“A fruit is a disgrace to the wealthy.
And a veggie, man, is way more healthy.”

“I don’t think that’s true.” Shut up, Brian.”
Fruits are the worst, so STOP LYING!!”

“Peas, Carrots, I don’t know, stuff?
Always remember, VEGGIES ARE LOVE!”

“A little fruit would never hurt.”
“Don’t eat that, Brian, you little nerd.”

“Pineapples are spiky,
Apples won’t do.
That’s why we’re healthy!
THE HEALTHY CREW!!”
```
